# DecoyAuth

This project will research, develop, and standardize an innovative zero-knowledge authentication protocol that supports decoy tokens. The decoy tokens act like a reverse honeypot, where usage of a stolen or leaked token indicates a security breach, triggering appropriate security measures.

This is done as part of the Decoy-Auth project funded by [NGI Sargasso](https://ngisargasso.eu/innovators/).

# Background

Zero-knowledge authentication has major advantages. In particular, when using general-purpose keys, or traditional passwords, the counterparty only learns whether the correct key was used, without learning the value of the used key. Unfortunately, using decoy tokens (or decoy passwords) with existing zero-knowledge protocols is impossible. In this project, we overcome this limitation by adding support for decoy keys to zero-knowledge authentication protocols. The decoy tokens act as a reverse honey pot: a decoy key is indistinguishable from a real key, and when an adversary steals or uses a decoy key, the counterparty can detect this and take appropriate security measures.

The result will be the design, implementation, and standardization of an innovative zero-knowledge authentication protocol that supports decoy tokens. By supporting a decoy token mechanism, we expect a substantial increase in breach detections, leading to faster and more effective responses to security incidents.

More broadly, we hope our work will also be the basis of other future research on extending zero-knowledge authentication. In particular, we believe it might also form inspiration for adding multi-password support to WPA3.
